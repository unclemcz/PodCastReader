 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/797/what-i-was-thinking-as-we-were-sinking</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s funny the things that go through your head during a disaster.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Host Ira Glass has fallen off his bike a number of times at this point. He reflects on what goes through his head as he’s going down. (2 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Producer Ike Sriskandarajah revisits a maritime disaster that left an impact on a group of friends from his youth. What he learns forever changes their impressions of that day. (23 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: When to leave Twitter is a question lots of executives faced when Elon Musk took over the company — those who weren&#039;t immediately fired, anyway. We hear an insider’s account from the man who ran Trust &amp; Safety at the company, until he couldn’t stand it anymore.

 <title>833: Come Retribution</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/833/come-retribution</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has talked about taking retribution on his enemies since the early days of his 2024 presidential campaign. After his conviction last week in New York, his talk intensified. We try to understand what his retribution might look like by speaking with people who have the most to lose in a second Trump administration: people who believe Trump will be coming for them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Donald Trump has talked about taking revenge on his enemies since the early days of his 2024 presidential campaign. Ira Glass talks to reporter Jonathan Karl about how Trump has placed retribution at the center of his run and what we know about how he’s thinking about it. (16 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Reporter Alix Spiegel talks to two people with good reason to fear a second Trump administration. Former White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham spent six years with the Trumps but resigned after January 6th and wrote a scathing tell-all book about her experience. Fred Wellman worked for The Lincoln Project - a group of high-profile Republicans who pledged to keep Trump out of office during the 2020 campaign. (22 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Alex Vindman became the face of the first Trump impeachment after he reported to his superiors that Trump had asked the President of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of his political opponent. At the time, Vindman believed that his Congressional testimony would not jeopardize him; now, he and his wife Rachel are having second thoughts. (14 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Three: After hearing from people who dread a possible second Trump term, we hear from those who are excited about it. Reporter Zoe Chace checks into whether his supporters are excited for retribution. (7 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/833/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>831: Lists!!!</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/831/lists</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;How they organize the chaos of the world, for good and for bad.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Ira interviews David Wallechinsky, who wrote a wildly popular book in the 1970s called The Book of Lists, full of trivia and research, gathered into lists like &quot;18 Brains&quot; and &quot;What They Weighed.&quot; The book sold millions of copies and had four sequels and a brief spin-off TV show. The list books were like the internet, before the internet. (12 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: John Fecile talks to his brother, Pat, about a list their other brother made before he died. They each have different ideas about what the list means and how they feel about it. (14 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act 2: A brief visit with Bobby, who keeps a list in his phone of all the dogs in his neighborhood and their names to save him from the awkwardness of not knowing the name of someone’s dog – because people get upset if you don’t remember their dog’s name. (3 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Reporter Masha Gessen talks to Russians living in America and elsewhere, about lists they’ve been put on by the Russian government in the last few years. Masha is also on one of these lists. Each list has its own complex rules and potential consequences, for the people on the lists and for their family members who live in Russia.

 <title>830: The Forever Trial</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/830/the-forever-trial</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The trial for the men accused of orchestrating the September 11 terrorist attacks still hasn’t started yet. Family members of those who died that day are still hoping for some kind of accountability, more than 22 years later. This week, the story of how one victim’s sister is navigating this historic and twisted trial.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Host Ira Glass introduces the new series that Serial is doing about Guantánamo Bay. This is the second of two episodes of theirs that we’re airing. (2 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: We meet Colleen Kelly, a member of September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, and learn just how upside down and messed up the trial for the 9/11 accused has been over the past decade. (28 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Sarah Koenig explains what’s probably the best possible outcome that everyone can hope for at this point. And why, when it hits the news someday — if it ever happens — it’s sure to be deeply misunderstood by lots of people. Plus a trip to Guantánamo with Colleen. (31 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/830/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>552: Need To Know Basis</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/552/need-to-know-basis</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Even when you&#039;re not trying to get one over on someone, it can be useful to keep the truth to yourself. Or conversely, to not know why people are lying to your face all the time. This week we&#039;ll tell you the whole truth about not telling the whole truth. Including the story of a guy who learned to lie for the first time in his life at age 29.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ira talks with a guy in Chicago named Josh who likes to spend time going bird watching. But one day, 
Josh was out in a park with his binoculars and he discovered something he definitely did not want to 
know about. (6 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Michael Leviton was raised in a family who encouraged him and his siblings to tell the truth all the time. They believed it was better to be honest and work things out. Even when it was uncomfortable. But as Michael tells Ira, when he became an adult, he discovered that the world his parents created had its limitations. (19 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Producer Zoe Chace tells the story of a community college student named Demetrius who seemed like he was doing exceptionally well in school. But as Zoe followed Demetrius over a semester, she discovered that there were things about his academic past that he had kept a secret. And not just from her. (20 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Three: Growing up, producer Stephanie Foo was the favorite child of her family in Malaysia. Particularly of the matriarch of the family who everyone called &quot;Auntie.&quot; But as an adult, Stephanie found out the complicated truth about why she was the family favorite. (13 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/552/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
